# Git - The World's most popular version control system

## Git is what's known as a version control system (VCS). In fact, it's the world's most popular VCS.

- Essentially, version control is software that helps track and manage changes to a set of files over time.

- Some of the more well-known version control systems include Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial. They all share the common goal of helping developers and users track changes to projects over time.

- According to the 2018 Stack Overflow developer survey, nearly 90% of respondents reported that Git was their version control system of choice.

## What Git help us to

- Track changes across multiple files.

- Compare different versions of a project. Revisit old versions ("time travel").

- Revert to a previous version. Collaborate and share changes.

- Merge changes from multiple contributors.

## Linus Torvalds 

- Linux Torvalds is the creator and main developer behind Linux and Git. In 2005, while working on Linux, he became frustrated with the available version control systems, finding them slow, closed-source, and often requiring payment.

- Torvalds wanted a version control system that was both super fast and free, unlike the existing tools. On April 3, 2005, he began working on his own VCS, which would become Git. In just a few days, he had implemented most of the basic functionality.

- The first official Git release came a couple of months later. By 2020, 15 years later, over 90% of developers worldwide were using Git on a daily basis!

## Git Vs Github

- Git: Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows developers to manage code repositories, track modifications, collaborate with others, and maintain project history. Git operates locally on your machine, providing powerful tools for branching, merging, and managing different versions of your code.

- GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration features. It offers a graphical interface for managing repositories, tracking issues, and reviewing pull requests. GitHub is a popular service for sharing code and collaborating with other developers online, but it is built on top of Git, which means it uses Git as its underlying version control system.
