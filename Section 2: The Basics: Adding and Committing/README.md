# Repository: 

### A Git repository (or "repo") is a workspace that tracks and manages files within a folder.

- To use Git for a project or application, you need to create a new Git repository.

- You can have multiple repositories on your machine, each with its own history and content, allowing you to manage different projects independently.

```sh
   git --version
   ```
- Is a command used to show the current state of your working directory and staging area. It tells you which files have been modified, which files are staged for the next commit, and which files are not being tracked by Git. Essentially, it helps you see what changes youâ€™ve made and what is ready to be committed.
  
```sh
   git --status
   ```
