# Branches

## Branches are an essential part of Git! Think of branches as alternative timelines for a project. 

- They let us create separate contexts to try new ideas or work on multiple features in parallel.

- Changes made on one branch do not affect other branches unless we merge those changes.

## The Master Branch

- The master branch: In Git, you are always working on a branch, and by default, this branch is named master.

- The master branch doesnâ€™t have any special features or powers; it functions just like any other branch.
